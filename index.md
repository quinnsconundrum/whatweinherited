# Vintage: On Those Who Love (and Hate) the Conn 8D
*By Quinn Foster*

## Prelude: C.G. Conn – A Blogger Before Gawker; A Shit-Talker That Would Make 50 Cent Proud

In Los Angeles in 1923, Charles Gerard Conn published a book called *The Wonder Book: How to Achieve Success*. A Hail Mary project to regain relevance, *Wonder* was filled with his stories as a Civil War Union Army Captain, gems about founding a half dozen companies (including his instrument company in 1883), winning an election in Congress, and serving as mayor in an industrial boomtown. Conn was a successful man indeed. Alas, Conn’s potential successes as a self-help author were undermined by his true passion: talking shit.

Three decades prior to *Wonder*, Conn founded *The Elkhart Truth*, a highly respected little newspaper for his Indiana town’s namesake. Far more interesting is his other publication, *The Gossip*, which he used for the world’s second oldest profession: being a petty bastard. After a series of poor investments and a wet bible’s worth of questionable—and soon to be legally defensible—publications about his competitors, he found himself out of money and about to hand his rivals even more money.

Most of Conn’s assets—his successful instrument company and *The Elkhart Truth* newspaper—were sold in 1915 to pay massive debts. Divorced, booted from his Elkhart estate, penniless, and in the winter of his life, Conn saw his luck permanently run dry. If anyone ever idolized the wondrous Conn, they certainly didn’t in 1923—just eight short years before he would die, thousands of miles away from the ashes of his former empire.¹²³

## Our Case Study

There is no more important American French horn in history than that of Conn’s namesake, the Conn 8D. Its rich sound has dominated the most important titles in cinema, soaring over Princess Leia and Indiana Jones alike. During the twentieth century, Conn after Conn sat on the slacks of crusty old men who won their orchestra auditions in directors’ hotel rooms, where the only screen was unfiltered cigarette smoke and leaded gasoline fumes. When serious students chose a horn, there was no choice. They played a Conn and only a Conn.

Despite its decades-long domination in the United States, many players would say it is a horn best left to history. The Conn 8D is the crown jewel of love-hate relationships in French horn playing. Modern professional horn players are sure to receive at least an eyebrow raise if they bust one out on a gig, if not a full-blown pointing and haha-ing. The Conn has shifted slowly from professional default to vintage voice, but without the language to reflect that change.

In mid-2019, while on tour playing a grueling horn part in the pit, I hung up my Conn in favor of an “easier instrument.” The former principal trumpet of a major orchestra would be at one such show and remark, “I’m so glad you finally let go of that thing. I’m not sure what you were working so hard for.” After all, Conns are a tough blow.

Rewind. It is September 2017. I am at an audition for the Princeton Symphony that I am utterly mediumly prepared for. I warm up in a room full of familiar and unfamiliar faces. I hold in my hands the room’s only Conn 8D. I am immediately approached by an old friend and colleague, also a former 8D player: “Man, you’re still rockin the ‘65 Chevy!”

I proceeded to play as mediumly as I prepared at the Princeton audition for reasons unrelated to my horn being a Conn. But I did think to myself: Was it the Conn? Would I have hit more notes with an instrument manufactured sometime after the Coolidge administration? Would I have sounded more like the eccentric principal horn behind the curtain had I just stopped being stubborn and bought a triple?

Is my illustrious vintage taste holding me back?

## Phil Myers

In the late nineties, up the street in New York Fawkin City, a horn player by the name of Phil Myers thought the same thing I did: What if my commitment to the Conn is doing me no favors? Phil’s playing, by his own account, suffered from imperfect articulation in the midrange and lack of control when deciding to make certain louder dynamics brassy or not brassy.⁴

And despite his undeniable prowess as the principal horn of the New York Philharmonic, Phil Myers’s cracks, chips, and cockadoodledoos were so legendary that the *New York Times* wrote an entire article about whether our instrument is even relevant—and that was many years after he switched to an “easier” instrument, the brand of which will be discussed later.⁵

## The Equipment Change

The Conn 8D had become essential to the New York sound, and Phil was something of a standard bearer. Which horn could possibly replace it? Which horn builder would be the lucky wall flower at the dance? Cut to a then little-known horn maker across the pond in Germany, Englebert Schmid, and his full triple French horn.⁶

Phil bought one, and most of his section soon followed, saving their Conns for other endeavors like bashing out the windows of Joe Alessi’s PT Cruiser. Soon, throes upon throes of horn players across New York and the rest of the United States would be playing triples (and, as I will detail, horns with a Geyer wrap), and a legion of Conn 8D fanboys would be complaining about it. Phil’s decision profoundly changed the game.
