# Vintage: On Those Who Love (and Hate) the Conn 8D
*By Quinn Foster*


## Prelude: C. G. Conn — A Blogger Before Gawker; A Shit-Talker That Would Make 50 Proud

In Los Angeles in 1923, Charles Gerard Conn published a book called *The Wonder Book: How to Achieve Success*. A hail-mary project to regain relevance, *Wonder* was filled with stories of his time as a Civil War Union Army captain, gems about founding a half-dozen companies (at least two of which would last well into the twenty-first century), winning an election to Congress, and mayoring an industrial boomtown. Conn was a successful man indeed. Alas, Conn’s potential successes as a self-help author were undermined by his true passion: talking shit.

Conn founded *The Elkhart Truth*, a highly respected little newspaper for his town’s namesake, in 1887. Far more interesting is his other publication, *The Gossip*, which he used for the world’s second-oldest profession: being a petty bastard. After a series of poor investments and a wet Bible’s worth of questionable—and soon-to-be legally defensible—publications about his competitors, he found himself out of money and about to hand his rivals even more money.

Most of Conn’s assets—his successful instrument company and *The Elkhart Truth* newspaper—were sold in 1915 to pay massive debts. Divorced, booted from his Elkhart estate, penniless, and in the winter of his life, Conn saw his luck permanently run dry. If anyone ever idolized the wondrous Conn, they certainly didn’t in 1923—just eight short years before he would die, thousands of miles away from the ashes of his former empire.[^1][^2][^3]

## Our Case Study

There is no more important American French horn in history than that of Conn’s namesake, the Conn 8D. Its rich sound has dominated the most important titles in cinema, soaring over Princess Leia and Indiana Jones alike. During the twentieth century, in hundreds of orchestras, Conn after Conn sat on the slacks of crusty old men who won their auditions in directors’ hotel rooms where the only screen was unfiltered cigarette smoke and leaded gasoline fumes. When serious students chose a horn, there was no choice. They played a Conn, and only a Conn.

Despite its decades-long domination in the United States, many players would say it is a horn best left to history. The Conn 8D is the crown jewel of love-hate relationships in French horn playing. Modern professional horn players are sure to receive at least an eyebrow raise if they bust one out on a gig—if not a full pointing and *haha-ing*.

In mid-2019, while on tour playing a grueling horn part in the pit, I hung up my Conn in favor of an “easier instrument.” The former principal trumpet of a major orchestra would be at one such show and tell me, “I’m so glad you finally let go of that thing. I’m not sure what you were working so hard for.” After all, Conns are a tough blow.

Rewind. It is September 2017. I am at an audition for the Princeton Symphony that I am utterly *mediumly* prepared for. I warm up in a room full of familiar and unfamiliar faces, many of us having subbed here before. I hold in my hands the room’s only Conn 8D. I am immediately approached by an old friend and colleague, also a former 8D player:

> “Man, you’re still rockin’ the ’65 Chevy!”

I proceeded to play as mediumly as I prepared at the Princeton audition—for reasons unrelated to my horn being a Conn. But I did think to myself: *Was it the Conn? Would I have hit more notes with an instrument manufactured sometime after the Coolidge administration? Would I have sounded more like the eccentric principal horn behind the curtain had I just stopped being stubborn and bought a triple?*

Is my illustrious vintage taste holding me back?

## Phil Myers

In the late nineties, up the street in New York *fawkin’* City, a horn player by the name of Phil Myers thought the same thing I did: *What if my commitment to the Conn is doing me no favors?*

Phil’s playing, by his own account, suffered from imperfect articulation in the midrange and lack of control when deciding to make certain louder dynamics brassy or not brassy.[^4]

And despite his undeniable prowess as the principal horn of the New York Philharmonic, Phil Myers’s cracks, chips, and cockadoodledoos were so legendary that *The New York Times* wrote an entire article about whether our instrument is even relevant—and that was many years after he switched to an “easier” instrument.[^5]

## The Equipment Change

The Conn 8D had become essential to the New York sound, and Phil was something of a standard bearer. Which horn could possibly replace it?

Cut to a then little-known horn maker across the pond in Germany, Englebert Schmid, and his full triple French horn.[^fn-triple]

Phil bought one, and most of his section soon followed, saving their Conns for other endeavors like bashing out the windows of Joe Alessi’s PT Cruiser. Soon, droves of horn players across New York and the rest of the United States would be playing triples (and, as I will get to, Geyer-wrap horns), and a legion of Conn 8D fanboys would be complaining about it. Phil’s decision profoundly changed the game for horn players.

Triple horns feature a high F or E-flat horn activated by a change valve, making accuracy in the upper register much easier. More importantly, triples represented a philosophical shift. Their sound was not your grandpa’s French horn sound. To eager adopters, it was direct and sizzly—helpful for matching our feistier brass cousins and more forgiving at the end of a long concert.

To those sipping haterade—the Conn 8D evangelists—the Schmid was hardly more than a curly-shaped trombone in timbre. It was edgy and two-dimensional. Most importantly, it was a rebuke of the philosophy that shaped the New York French horn sound. To diehards, Phil Myers and the Schmid adopters were not just bucking a trend. They were traitors.

## The Abilene Problem

Phil’s switch was not ground zero for the Conn 8D’s decline. That blow came decades earlier.

In 1969 and 1970, Conn moved its factory from Elkhart, Indiana, to Abilene, Texas. The quality of the Conns produced in Abilene were, by and large, bong water. Conical valves were replaced with cylindrical ones, hollow bracings held the pipes together, and C. G. Conn, Ltd. opted for cheaper labor performed by less-experienced factory workers.[^6]

When professionals now look to buy a Conn 8D, one question is paramount: *Where was it made?*

## Historical Context: A Natural Disaster

Once upon a time, the horn was a valveless tube known as a natural horn. Similar to a bugle, it had a mouthpiece at one end and a bell at the other. There was one person who managed to not sound like a basset hound in duress named Lowell Greer (RIP). We paid him a large sum of money to fly all over the country performing with period orchestras and dealing with the consequences of his life choices.

At some point, someone didn’t want their playing to sound like a basset hound in duress anymore, and so they invented a valve. Then another. Then another.

This worked well for brass instruments that weren’t utterly ridiculous—like the horn.

## The Double Horn and the Wrap Wars

If a debate about change-valve placement sounds like something that normal people should lack pretension about, congratulations on having met zero French horn players in your life.

Enter Carl Geyer and Ed Kruspe, creators of the two dominant French horn wraps. The Conn 8D is almost an exact replica of the Kruspe horn. The Geyer—its mortal enemy—would soon aid triple horns in permanently annihilating the Conn’s modern relevance.[^7]

Hornists love to say that no wrap “won.”

This is total bullshit.

Geyer won. By a lot.

## Biggie vs. Tupac

Like the horn’s two most important wraps, the two most important hip-hop artists in history are Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur. Aesthetics were debated endlessly. Geography mattered. Taste mattered.

Then history happened.

Biggie’s influence carried forward by the thousands. Tupac became vintage—important, charming, and unmistakably of his time.

The Conn is Tupac.

## So, What Are Conns Good For?

The Conn is fabulous on a microphone. It can be glorious when *everyone* plays one. It shines as a curated color rather than a default.

The Conn didn’t just shape American horn playing—it defined professionalism long enough that we forgot it was a stylistic choice.

The ship has sailed. The Conn is a vintage voice now. Refusing to acknowledge that shift is what keeps the love-hate relationship alive.

And yes—I still love mine.
